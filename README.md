- 👋 Hi, I’m CindyHansen
- 👀 I’m interested in developing open source code that can be used to measure and report on wellbeing, engagement and goals, internationally, to individual users and their healthcare providers.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to read code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a client facing app that collects responses, stores PHI, calculates and reports results on the app and sends de-identified results to cloud where they can give permission to share results in real time with healthcare provider web app dashboard or EHR dashboard in real time. 
- 📫 How to reach me email: OutcomesCindyHansenCFT.com or +1 2367688738.
